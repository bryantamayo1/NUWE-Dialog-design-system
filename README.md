![alt text](https://github.com/bryantamayo1/NUWE-Dialog-design-system/blob/master/src/assets/imgs/dialog_system.PNG?raw=true "Image 1")
This project was created with reusable and modular components, we can make a distinction between three state cards like: *warning*, *success* and *error*.

## Installation
```shell
    # Install dependencies
    npm i
    # Run project
    npm start
    # Run tests
    npm run test
```

## Stack
React, Typescript, Vite, vitest and styled-components (all styles was created with styled-components because we take advantage the props to select a different state *warning*, *success* and *error*).
